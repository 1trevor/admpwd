# AdmPwd project
This is source code for AdmPwd project that has been previously hosted on MSDN gallery - project has been used as base for Microsoft branded LAPS solution.

Enhancements over Microsoft LAPS:

* installer supported on pure 64-bit Windows without WoW64


Moved to github so as make it easier to allow cooperation, contribution and development of the solution. For details on current functionality, see release note for releases.
